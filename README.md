## An Interesting Article About Software Development

### [How Software Development is Changing Forever, and How You'll Need to Change With It](https://dev.to/jdbar/how-software-development-is-changing-forever-and-how-youll-need-to-change-with-it-1jih)

This article highlights how software development is dynamic and constantly evolving. By emphasizing the shift towards automation, low-code platforms, and AI driven tools, the author assures that developers should'nt worry about being replaced. Although AI platforms such at ChatGPT spit out code at fast speeds, they are just another tool in the process of development. Therefore, new tools don't decrease job oppurtunities, but rather create them. What I found particulary interesting is the focus on how these advancments are reducing barriers to entry into the software industry. By making technology more acessible, traditonal developers are forced to adapt by embracing more creative-thinking roles, not just the typical programmer writing code.

## Comment from Apollo Wyndham

From the very beginning the article highlights how AI is not necessarily the end of software development but instead is a new opportunity for developers to focus in on skills that are not easily replacable. It brings up how important it is to adapt and work alongside AI in a way that will benefit the worker and the company. Developers who learn to use the tool will have even more opportunities when their more repetitive tasks are automated.
