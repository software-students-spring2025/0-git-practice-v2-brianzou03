The article covers the career journey of Lindsey Redd, who has worked for many leading tech companies. She talks about her path and challenges, as well as offering advice to those interested in becoming a software engineer. Some of my favorite takeaways from the article are: 1. Introductory computer science classes make the subject accessible, and is often a way that others may switch into the discipline from a different major. 2. Internships are critical, and obtaining them requires more than just technical skills - they also require communication, curiosity, and the ability to solve difficult problems. 3. Interviewing for roles often includes coding challenges, which may not reflect actual job tasks. 4. Navigating the terrain of the industry may be difficult, but tools like LinkedIn make the job hunt easier.

### Comment from Shamaamah Ahmad

In the article, one part discusses how software engineering requires constant learning to keep up with technological advances. I agree with this point, as the tech landscape evolves rapidly, making it essential for engineers to be lifelong learners. This constant challenge can be exciting, but also demanding. Itâ€™s a field where adapting to change becomes the norm, and those who thrive are typically the ones who embrace new tools with positivity!
