The article covers the career journey of Lindsey Redd, who has worked for many leading tech companies. She talks about her path and challenges, as well as offering advice to those interested in becoming a software engineer. Some of my favorite takeaways from the article are: 1. Introductory computer science classes make the subject accessible, and is often a way that others may switch into the discipline from a different major. 2. Internships are critical, and obtaining them requires more than just technical skills - they also require communication, curiosity, and the ability to solve difficult problems. 3. Interviewing for roles often includes coding challenges, which may not reflect actual job tasks. 4. Navigating the terrain of the industry may be difficult, but tools like LinkedIn make the job hunt easier.

I think there is definetely a lot to know about the software engineering job hunt that is not taught to students in university and Lindsey Redd does a good job on giving the essential pointers. Experience and interpersonal skills are very important both in the interview process and work environment. I also do agree that interviews tend to be quite hard but often do no reflect what you will be doing at the job.

I find the article interesting as it talks about Lindsey Redd's career path to becoming a software engineer which parallels alot with my own journey through college. She also tackles alot of misconceptions revolving around what it means to be a software engineer; its not just about coding, but also communication, management, adaptability, etc.
