### This article highlights how software development is dynamic and constantly evolving. By emphasizing the shift towards automation, low-code platforms, and AI driven tools, the author assures that developers should'nt worry about being replaced. Although AI platforms such at ChatGPT spit out code at fast speeds, they are just another tool in the process of development. Therefore, new tools don't decrease job oppurtunities, but rather create them. What I found particulary interesting is the focus on how these advancments are reducing barriers to entry into the software industry. By making technology more acessible, traditonal developers are forced to adapt by embracing more creative-thinking roles, not just the typical programmer writing code.
